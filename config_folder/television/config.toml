# branches to choose from.

# Add your channel triggers here. Each key is a channel that will be triggered
# by the corresponding commands.
# Example: say you want the following commands to trigger the following channels
# when pressing <CTRL-T>:
#          `git checkout`  should trigger the `git-branches` channel
#          `ls`            should trigger the `dirs` channel
#          `cat` and `cp`  should trigger the `files` channel
#
# You would add the following to your configuration file:
# ```
# [shell_integration.channel_triggers]
# "git-branches" = ["git checkout"]
# "dirs" = ["ls"]
# "files" = ["cat", "cp"]
